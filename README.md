Database Integration: Likely supports SQLite, MySQL, or other databases for data persistence.
CRUD Operations: Enables seamless management of data with endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
Scalability: Designed for extensibility and suitable for production-level deployments.
This project is an excellent starting point for developers looking to learn or implement RESTful APIs with Python.
