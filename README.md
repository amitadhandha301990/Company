# Company Management Structure

This project demonstrates a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using FastAPI, a modern Python framework for building APIs. The application provides a streamlined and efficient backend solution for managing resources, featuring:

FastAPI Framework: Ensures high performance and easy integration.
Database Integration: Likely supports SQLite, MySQL, or other databases for data persistence.
CRUD Operations: Enables seamless management of data with endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
Scalability: Designed for extensibility and suitable for production-level deployments.
This project is an excellent starting point for developers looking to learn or implement RESTful APIs with Python.
